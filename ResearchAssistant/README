- Fixed a few more bugs: "Show Traitless" wasn't being auto-disabled when
"Show Learned" was disabled. And a function was not working for ornate jewelery.

0.8.1:
- Fixed several bugs introduced in last update: showing "research me" icon on
traitless items, throwing errors when jewelery or disguises are in inventory,
"Hide icon for known traits" not working.

0.8.0: 
- Revamped the Cross-Character system completely. Instead of self-tracking being
the norm and cross-character tracking being a special case, cross-character tracking
is the norm, and each category can be set individually to self or off if self-tracking
is desired. This also fixes bugs where indicators were changing color in "weird" ways
while cross-character tracking was turned on.
- Fixed a bug where Intricate and Ornate icons were not being displayed in the right
place in Inventory Grid View.
- Split Leatherworking from Clothier items, and split Weaponsmithing from Armorsmithing
items. These can now be tracked for separate characters, or linked like they used to be.

- Updated maintainer to katkat42. Thank you, ingeniousclown, for your service, and 
for trusting me with your code. I'll try to do it justice!
- Fixed bug where first item in inventory was not being scanned properly (thanks Garkin!)
